									How To Make An Audiobook
								</h2>
								<p>
									Before the invention of the printing press, every book was written by hand. Writing books by hand was a long and tedious task; the writers toiled day and night to copy a book. Due to which these writers made only a few copies of a book. These books were a rarity, and only the wealthiest men had the money to buy or read these books. The shortage of books limited the number of intellectuals in the past.
								</p>
								<p>
									But in 1450, the printing press was perfected by Johannes Guttenberg; this was a revolutionary feat for Humanity; in fact, I'd put this on the same level of significance as the moon landing. 
								</p>
								<p>
									To put it in context for an average person, this had the same effect that the internet has had on our world. The analogy is not that fitting, but it explains how much this impacted the world at that time.
								</p>
								<p>
									For the first time, every man had the opportunity to pick up a book and read. This sudden increase in the number of books available to the masses was huge at that time, mass publications sprung up across the lands, and soon everyone was hooked. Books made transferring knowledge from one generation to the other easy.
								</p>
								<p>
									Books made it viable for any person to travel the world while in the comfort of their house. Imagination is a tool that many visionaries used to bring to life some of the greatest inventions, pushing Humanity in the right direction.
								</p>
								<p>
									Simply put, books become an essential part of being a human; to be a human is to think about the future. Humans are the only species on earth who think about the future, differentiating us from the other animals. Books help us jot down our vision and let everyone else know about our theories, stories, and conclusions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Reading a book is a healthy exercise for every human. In his book The Republic, Plato gives excellent insights into the correlation between physical and mental health. A man should train his body and mind alike because a man with only physical strength is no more capable than a bull. After all, he can't think much more profoundly. So to be a human is to be physically and mentally fit. And there's no better mental exercise than reading a book!
								</p>
								<p>
									The impact of books on human civilization is immense, and we can't even start comprehending its positives effects as there are so many. But in this modern age, people are deviating away from books, the attention spans of humans have dropped significantly. We only consume media that is short.
								</p>
								<p>
									This overconsumption of small videos is having a nasty effect on our ability to focus, apps like tik tok and reels are the pinnacle of tomfoolery, but still, they have billions of users. The big corporations have managed to exploit our short attention spans. But, though the number of people reading books has decreased, the number of people listening to audiobooks has seen exponential growth!
								</p>
								<h2 class="service-single-title mb-20">
									What are audiobooks?
								</h2>
								<p>
									More people are tuning in to audiobooks and podcasts every day. But what are these audiobooks, and why is everyone talking about them now?
								</p>
								<p>
									Simply put, an audiobook is a book but in audio format. A person narrates the entirety of a book. This industry has seen steady growth for years now and shows no signs of stopping at all. 
								</p>
								<h2 class="service-single-title mb-20">
									Why audiobooks over reading?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Before, to read, you had to take much time off from your daily work and chores. Now you can listen to books while doing your daily tasks or commuting. Humans might've messed up their attention spans, but the thirst for knowledge still exists. It exists in every human to the day.
								</p>
								<p>
									Audiobooks are a great way of introducing young children to the world of books. Especially fantasy novels, these books have great narrators who role-play the various characters in the book, mimicking the voice. Listening to a fantasy novel is the same as watching a movie, but rather than caring about someone else's vision of how the book may look, you get to imagine your version of the book.
								</p>
								<p>
									Imagination drives the entire book industry; people love to develop their version of the sceneries and characters in the book. For nonfiction books, it is not that prevalent, but nonfiction books have their advantages too. Reading a nonfiction book is like exercising your brain; you get to know more about many things, about yourself, and how the world works. A good nonfiction book is enough to change the course of your life.
								</p>
								<p>
									NonfictionNonfiction books are boring for an average person, but in the audiobook format, they'd enjoy it. Audiobooks can condense an entire book into a 4-5 hour long mp3 which you can quickly finish in a week. Listening to books while doing other menial chores saves us a lot of time and money as well. Paperback books aren't cheap, and there's the bonus of carrying these heavy books wherever you go. It's too much of a hassle.
								</p>
								<p>
									A simple e-book or audiobook is the way to go. Many people would still prefer reading from a paperback to an e-book or listening to an audiobook, and that's fine. It would help if you did whatever you are the most comfortable with; listening to books makes you recall more things than do it. Books are tools, and it is in the user's hand (that is, you) to make the most of these tools.
								</p>
								<h2 class="service-single-title mb-20">
									Why make an audiobook?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Simply put, the audiobook market is vast; there is room for every genre of book. The audiobook boom has still not reached its full potential, the only reason being that many readers are still not available in the audiobook format. 
								</p>
								<p>
									People want more options, and if they have more options, they will keep coming back to audiobooks if there are many available in the market. Authors want to make their book available in the mp3 format. Still, this preconceived notion that creating an audiobook will leave a massive dent in the wallet, especially if you're a small and independent author.
								</p>
								<p>
									But you will be amazed to hear that this notion is not accurate at all. Creating an audiobook will require money, but it is not an astronomical amount that people think it is. Any novice can create an audiobook with a small budget.
								</p>
								<p>
									Just look at the podcast industry; there are so many podcasts out right now that cover a plethora of topics ranging from politics to nursery rhymes. So if you're having a second thought about creating an audiobook, leave it aside, as the technology and expertise needed for creating an audiobook are available online, and most of it is for free!
								</p>
								<p>
									Also, as an author, it is crucial for you to think about capitalizing on the book you've created; you've put in the work now that it is time to reap the fruits of your labor. It may seem intimidating for an independent author, but everything in life requires some work, so it is essential to trust the process.

									Our narrators will make sure your story is told the way you intended it to be; with great voice actors at our disposal, we assure you that you won't be disappointed. Every audiobook needs an emotional touch so that the listener can relate to the story. We here at audiobookmakers understand that; hence, we make our audiobooks keep that in mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									We offer our services in multiple languages, so if you want your book to be available to an even wider audience, we're here for you.
								</p>
 								<p>
									Now you can easily give us your book to be converted in the audiobook format, which will be on par with industry giants, which will only increase the number of listeners you get, Or you on record on your own.
								</p>
								<h3 class="mb-20">
									Step 1: Obtaining the right equipment is the key!
								</h3>
								<p>
									When making an audiobook, the first thing to keep in mind is the audio quality. Think of it this way, will you listen to an audiobook if it has a poor quality sound? No, right, then why would you make a product which you don't like. Your audio should be at its best at the time of RecordingRecording, and the only way to achieve this is by getting the right equipment.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you're setting up your own recording space, you will have to invest a few dollars. The first and the most crucial piece of equipment is the Mic. The Mic is directly responsible4 for your audio output, so make sure to get a good one. There are many options on Amazon and other sites.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can get a USB mic or a condenser microphone, remember to get a premium one; we want the audio to be as crisp as a fresh friend chip.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you get a mic, you'll also have to buy the boomstick, which ho9lds the Mic in position; along with that, also consider getting a pop filter; it will eliminate all the loud S’s in your voice. It may sound unnecessary at first, but believe us, it makes much difference.
								</p>
								<h3 class="mb-20">
									Step 2: Software
								</h3>
								<p>
									Now that you have your Mic and other hardware ready, it's time to install some good quality recording software. Don't worry; the best software is free. You can get Audacity or Garageband; it's on you. I'd go with Audacity as the interface is straightforward to grasp.
								</p>
								<p>
									Next, please get familiar with it and do a couple of test runs before you start recording.
								</p>
								<h3 class="mb-20">
									Step 3: Record!
								</h3>
								<p>
									Now that we have the entire setup in place, let's move on to the most fun part, RecordingRecording!
								</p>
								<p>
									Make sure you're throat isn't parched; drink water at regular intervals. Put some lip balm on your lips (I know it sounds weird, but trust us with this one). It'll help your lips to open and close smoothly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Your recording environment should be quiet; this doesn't mean you go and video in your closet. The closer you sit to a wall, the more are the chances of the voice echoing. So the easiest fix to this is soundproofing, but we're on a budget, so we'll just put up a blanket or a sheet on the wall; this will stop the echo.
								</p>
								<h3 class="mb-20">
									Step 4: Mastering the sound
								</h3>
								<p>
									Once the audio RecordingRecording is done, you should mix and master it to remove unnecessary sounds or add some sound effects at specific points in the narration. This can be quickly done using Audacity; youtube has a tone of tutorials on how to mix and master your audio.
								</p>
								<p>
									Don't worry; it isn't rocket science; it is pretty straightforward. This mastering will make your audiobook one of the best in the market. If you don't want to do it yourself, many freelancers on Fiverr and Upwork'll do it for a couple of dollars. This is less for the quality you get in return, so make sure to get your voice as perfect as possible!
								</p>
								<h3 class="mb-20">
									Step 5: Cover and Uploading process
								</h3>
								<p>
									Once you're satisfied with the audio, you need excellent cover art; you can use the book's cover art if you want or make a new one. Then just upload all of these to the audiobook website of your choice. We'd recommend our site for this.
								</p>
								<p>
									Doesn't this sound too much of a hassle? Why should you toil? Let us do the hard work while you sit back and relax. You probably have no experience with mics and RecordingRecording, so the logical thing to achieve a great audiobook is to let us handle it at audiobooksmaker.com.
								</p>
								<p>
									And you know what the best part is? If you try recording on your own, you'll have to spend a minimum of $150 just acquiring the right equipment, and you also have to register after that. We here at audiobook maker have packages starting from $15! 
								</p>
								<p>
									After working with clients from every continent on this planet, we've learned one thing, if you deliver a product that surpasses your client's expectations, you succeed. We have a diverse team to record your books in multiple languages; that is one of our main selling points; our team can get your book registered in the language of your choice!
								</p>
								<h2 class="service-single-title mb-20">
									Books that make great audiobooks!
								</h2>
								<p>
									Almost all writing heavy books make for good audiobooks; the only downside of audiobooks is that they can't6 display images. So image-heavy books shouldn't be made into an audiobook as there's no way to describe the image to the user. Apart from that, the following genres of books make for great audiobooks!
